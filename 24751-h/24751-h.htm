<h2>THE KITCHEN CAT</h2>

<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>

<h4>The Visitor from the Cellar</h4>

<p>The whole house in London was dull and
gloomy, its lofty rooms and staircases were filled
with a sort of misty twilight all day, and the sun
very seldom looked in at its windows. Ruth
Lorimer thought, however, that the very dullest
room of all was the nursery, in which she had
to pass so much of her time. It was so high
up that the people and carts and horses in the
street below looked like toys. She could not
even see these properly, because there were
iron bars to prevent her from stretching her
head out too far, so that all she could do was
to look straight across to the row of tall houses
opposite, or up at the sky between the chimney-pots.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
How she longed for something different
to look at!</p>

<p>The houses always looked the same, and
though the sky changed sometimes, it was often
of a dirty grey colour, and then Ruth gave a
little sigh and looked back from the window-seat
where she was kneeling, into the nursery,
for something to amuse her. It was full of all
sorts of toys&mdash;dolls, and dolls' houses elegantly
furnished, pictures and books and many pretty
things; but in spite of all these she often found
nothing to please her, for what she wanted more
than anything else was a companion of her own
age, and she had no brothers or sisters.</p>

<p>The dolls, however much she pretended, were
never glad, or sorry, or happy, or miserable&mdash;they
could not answer her when she talked to
them, and their beautiful bright eyes had a hard
unfeeling look which became very tiring, for
it never changed.</p>

<p>There was certainly Nurse Smith. She was
alive and real enough; there was no necessity
to "pretend" anything about her. She was
always there, sitting upright and flat-backed
beside her work-basket, frowning a little, not
because she was cross, but because she was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
rather near-sighted. She had come when Ruth
was quite a baby, after Mrs. Lorimer's death,
and Aunt Clarkson often spoke of her as "a
treasure". However that might be, she was
not an amusing companion; though she did her
best to answer all Ruth's questions, and was
always careful of her comfort, and particular
about her being neatly dressed.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was not her fault that she did not
understand games, and was quite unable to act
the part of any other character than her own.
If she did make the attempt, she failed so
miserably that Ruth had to tell her what to say,
which made it so flat and uninteresting that
she found it better to play alone. But she often
became weary of this; and there were times
when she was tired of her toys, and tired of
Nurse Smith, and did not know what in the
world to do with herself.</p>

<p>Each day passed much in the same way.
Ruth's governess came to teach her for an hour
every morning, and then after her early dinner
there was a walk with Nurse, generally in one
direction. And after tea it was time to go and
see her father&mdash;quite a long journey, through
the silent house, down the long stairs to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
dining-room where he sat alone at his dessert.</p>

<p>Ruth could not remember her mother, and
she saw so little of her father that he seemed
almost a stranger to her. He was so wonderfully
busy, and the world he lived in was such
a great way off from hers in the nursery.</p>

<p>In the morning he hurried away just as she
was at her breakfast, and all she knew of him
was the resounding slam of the hall door, which
came echoing up the staircase. Very often in
the evening he came hastily into the nursery to
say good-bye on his way out to some dinner-party,
and at night she woke up to hear his step
on the stairs as he came back late. But when
he dined at home Ruth always went downstairs
to dessert. Then, as she entered the large
sombre dining-room, where there were great
oil paintings on the walls and heavy hangings
to the windows, and serious-looking ponderous
furniture, her father would look up from his
book, or from papers spread on the table, and
nod kindly to her:</p>

<p>"Ah! it's you, Ruth. Quite well, eh? There's
a good child. Have an orange? That's right."</p>

<p>Then he would plunge into his reading again,
and Ruth would climb slowly on to a great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
mahogany chair placed ready for her, and
watch him as she cut up her orange.</p>

<p>She wondered very much why people wrote
him such long, long letters, all on blue paper
and tied up with pink tape. She felt sure they
were not nice letters, for his face always looked
worried over them; and when he had finished
he threw them on the floor, as though he were
glad. This made her so curious that she once
ventured to ask him what they were. They
were called "briefs", he told her. But she was
not much wiser; for, hearing from Nurse Smith
that "brief" was another word for short, she
felt sure there must be some mistake.</p>

<p>Exactly as the clock struck eight Nurse's
knock came at the door, Ruth got down from
her chair and said good-night.</p>

<p>Sometimes her father was so deeply engaged
in his reading that he stared at her with a far-away
look in his eyes, as if he scarcely knew
who she was. After a minute he said absently:
"Bed-time, eh? Good-night. Good-night, my
dear." Sometimes when he was a little less
absorbed he put a sixpence or a shilling into
her hand as he kissed her, and added: "There's
something to spend at the toy-shop."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>Ruth received these presents without much
surprise or joy. She was used to buying things,
and did not find it very interesting; for she
could not hope for any sign of pleasure from
her dolls when she brought them new clothes
or furniture.</p>

<p>It is a little dull when all one's efforts for
people are received with a perfectly unmoved
face. She had once brought Nurse Smith a
small china image, hoping that it would be
an agreeable surprise; but that had not been
successful either. "Lor', my dear, don't you
go spending your money on me," she said.
"Chany ornaments ain't much good for anything,
to my thinking, 'cept to ketch the
dust."</p>

<p>Thus it came to pass that Ruth never talked
much about what interested her either to her
father or to Nurse Smith, and as she had no
brothers and sisters she was obliged to amuse
herself with fancied conversations. Sometimes
these were carried on with her dolls, but her
chief friend was a picture which she passed
every night on the staircase. It was of a man
in a flat cap and a fur robe, and he had a pointed
smooth chin and narrow eyes, which seemed to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
follow her slyly on her way. She did not like
him and she did not actually fear him, but she
had a feeling that he listened to what she said,
and that she must tell him any news she had.
There was never much except on "Aunt Clarkson's
day", as she called it.</p>

<p>Aunt Clarkson was her father's sister. She
lived in the country, and had many little boys
and girls whom Ruth had seldom seen, though
she heard a great deal about them.</p>

<p>Once every month this aunt came up to
London for the day, had long conversations
with Nurse, and looked carefully at all Ruth's
clothes.</p>

<p>She was a sharp-eyed lady, and her visits
made a stir in the house which was like a cold
wind blowing, so that Ruth was glad when
they were over, though her aunt always spoke
kindly to her, and said: "Some day you must
come and see your little cousins in the
country."</p>

<p>She had said this so often without its having
happened, however, that Ruth had come to
look upon it as a mere form of speech&mdash;part
of Aunt Clarkson's visit, like saying "How d'ye
do?" or "Good-bye."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>It was shortly after one of these occasions
that quite by chance Ruth found a new friend,
who was better than either the dolls or the man
in the picture, because, though it could not
answer her, it was really alive. She discovered
it in this way.</p>

<p>One afternoon she and Nurse Smith had come
in from their usual walk, and were toiling
slowly up from the hall to the nursery. The
stairs got steeper at the last flight, and Nurse
went more slowly still, and panted a good deal,
for she was stouter than she need have been,
though Ruth would never have dreamed of
saying so. Ruth was in front, and she had
nearly reached the top when something came
hurrying towards her which surprised her very
much. It was a long, lean, grey cat. It had
a guilty look, as though it knew it had been
trespassing, and squeezed itself as close as it
could against the wall as it passed.</p>

<p>"Pretty puss!" said Ruth softly, and put out
her hand to stop it.</p>

<p>The cat at once arched up its back and gave
a friendly little answering mew. Ruth wondered
where it came from. It was ugly, she thought,
but it seemed a pleasant cat and glad to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
noticed. She rubbed its head gently. It felt
hard and rough like Nurse's old velvet bonnet;
there was indeed no sleekness about it anywhere,
and it was so thin that its sides nearly
met.</p>

<p>"Poor puss!" said Ruth stroking it tenderly.</p>

<p>The cat replied by pushing its head gently
against her arm, and presently began a low
purring song. Delighted, Ruth bent her ear to
listen.</p>

<p>"Whoosh! Shish! Get along! Scat!" suddenly
sounded from a few steps below. Nurse's
umbrella was violently flourished, the cat flew
downstairs with a spit like an angry firework,
and Ruth turned round indignantly.</p>

<p>"You <i>shouldn't</i> have done that," she said,
stamping her foot; "I wanted to talk to it.
Whose is it?"</p>

<p>"It's that nasty kitchen cat," said Nurse,
much excited, and grasping her umbrella spitefully.
"I'm not going to have it prowling about
on <i>my</i> landing. An ugly thieving thing, as has
no business above stairs at all."</p>

<p>Ruth pressed her face against the balusters.
In the distance below she could see the small
grey form of the kitchen cat making its way<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
swiftly and silently downstairs. It went so fast
that it seemed to float rather than to run, and
was soon out of sight.</p>

<p>"I should like to have played with it up in
the nursery," she said, with a sigh, as she continued
her way. "I wish you hadn't frightened
it away."</p>

<p>"Lor', Miss Ruth, my dear," answered Nurse,
"what can a little lady like you want with a
nasty, low, kitchen cat! Come up and play
with some of your beautiful toys, there's a
dear! Do."</p>

<p>Nevertheless Ruth thought about the cat a
great deal that afternoon, and the toys seemed
even less interesting than usual. When tea was
over, and Nurse had taken up her sewing again,
she began to make a few inquiries.</p>

<p>"Where does that cat live?" she asked.</p>

<p>"In the kitchen, to be sure," said Nurse;
"and the cellar, and coal-hole, and such like.
Alonger the rats and mice&mdash;and the beadles,"
she added, as an after-thought.</p>

<p>"The beadles!" repeated Ruth doubtfully.
"<i>What</i> beadles?"</p>

<p>"Why, the <i>black</i> beadles, to be sure," replied
Nurse cheerfully.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>Ruth was silent. It seemed dismal company
for the kitchen cat. Then she said:</p>

<p>"Are there many of them?"</p>

<p>"Swarms!" said Nurse, breaking off her
thread with a snap. "The kitchen's black with
'em at night."</p>

<p>What a dreadful picture!</p>

<p>"Who feeds the cat?" asked Ruth again.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't suppose nobody <i>feeds</i> it," answered
Nurse. "It lives on what it ketches
every now and then."</p>

<p>No wonder it looked thin! Poor kitchen cat!
How very miserable and lonely it must be with
no one to take care of it, and how dreadful
for it to have such nasty things to eat! And
the supply even of these must be short sometimes,
Ruth went on to consider. What did
it do when it could find no more mice or rats?
Of the beetles she could not bear even to think.
As she turned these things seriously over in her
mind she began to wish she could do something
to alter them, to make the cat's life more comfortable
and pleasant. If she could have it to
live with her in the nursery for instance, she
could give it some of her own bread and milk,
and part of her own dinner; then it would get<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
fatter and perhaps prettier too. She would tie
a ribbon round its neck, and it should sleep in
a basket lined with red flannel, and never be
scolded or chased about or hungry any more.
All these pictures were suddenly destroyed by
Nurse's voice:</p>

<p>"But I hope you'll not encourage it up here,
Miss Ruth, for I couldn't abide it, and I'm sure
your Aunt Clarkson wouldn't approve of it
neither. I've had a horror of cats myself from
a gal. They're that stealthy and treacherous,
you never know where they mayn't be hiding,
or when they won't spring out at you. If ever
I catch it up here I shall bannock it down
again."</p>

<p>There was evidently no sympathy to be
looked for from Nurse Smith; but Ruth was
used to keeping her thoughts and plans to herself,
and did not miss it much. As she could not
talk about it, however, she thought of her new
acquaintance all the more; it was indeed seldom
out of her mind, and while she seemed to be
quietly amusing herself in her usual way, she
was occupied with all sorts of plans and arrangements
for the cat when it should come to live
in the nursery. Meanwhile it was widely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
separated from her; how could she let it know
that she wanted to see it again? When she
went up and down stairs she peered and peeped
about to see if she could catch a glimpse of
its hurrying grey figure, and she never came
in from a walk without expecting to meet it
on her way to the nursery. But she never did.
The kitchen cat kept to its own quarters and
its own society. Perhaps it had been too often
"bannocked" down again to venture forth.
And yet Ruth felt sure that it had been glad
when she had spoken kindly to it. What a
pity that Nurse did not like cats!</p>

<p>She confided all this as usual to the man in
the picture, who received it with his narrow
observant glance and seemed to give it serious
consideration. Perhaps it was he who at last
gave her a splendid idea, which she hastened
to carry out as well as she could, though remembering
Nurse's strong expression of dislike
she felt obliged to do so with the greatest
secrecy.</p>

<p>As a first step, she examined the contents of
her little red purse. A whole shilling, a sixpence,
and a threepenny bit. That would be
more than enough. Might they go to some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
shops that afternoon, she asked, when she and
Nurse were starting for their walk.</p>

<p>"To be sure, Miss Ruth; and what sort
of shops do you want? Toy-shops, I suppose."</p>

<p>"N-no," said Ruth; "I think not. It must
be somewhere where they sell note-paper,
and a baker's, I <i>think</i>; but I'm not quite
sure."</p>

<p>Arrived at the stationer's, Ruth was a long
time before deciding on what she would have;
but at last, after the woman had turned over
a whole boxful, she came to some pink note-paper
with brightly painted heads of animals
upon it, and upon the envelopes also.</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Ruth when she saw it, clasping
her hands with delight. "<i>That</i> would do beautifully.
Only&mdash;<i>have</i> you any with a cat?"</p>

<p>Yes, there <i>was</i> some with a nice fluffy cat
upon it, and she left the shop quite satisfied
with her first purchase.</p>

<p>"And now," said Nurse briskly, whose patience
had been a good deal tried, "we must
make haste back, it's getting late."</p>

<p>But Ruth had still something on her mind.
She <i>must</i> go to one more shop, she said, though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
she did not know exactly which. At last she
fixed on a baker's.</p>

<p>"What should you think," she asked on the
way, "that a cat likes to eat better than anything
in the world?"</p>

<p>"Why, a mouse to be sure," answered Nurse
promptly.</p>

<p>"Well, but <i>next</i> to mice?" persisted Ruth.</p>

<p>"Fish," said Nurse Smith.</p>

<p>"That would never do," thought Ruth to
herself as she looked at a fish-shop they were
passing, "It's so wet and slippery I couldn't
possibly carry it home. Perhaps Nurse doesn't
<i>really</i> know what cats like best. Anyhow, I'm
sure it's never tasted anything so nice as a Bath
bun." A Bath bun was accordingly bought,
carried home, and put carefully away in the
doll's house. And now Ruth felt that she had
an important piece of business before her. She
spread out a sheet of the new writing-paper on
the window-seat, knelt in front of it with a
pencil in her hand, and ruled some lines. She
could not write very well, and was often uncertain
how to spell even short words; so she
bit the end of her pencil and sighed a good
deal before the letter was finished. At last it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
was done, and put into the envelope. But now
came a new difficulty: How should it be
addressed? After much thought she wrote the
following:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">The Kitchen Cat</span>,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The Kitchen,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">17 Gower Street.<br /></span>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>
<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>

<h4>Her Best Friend</h4>

<p>After this letter had been dropped into the
pillar-box just in front of the house, Ruth
began to look out still more eagerly for the
kitchen cat, but days passed and she caught no
glimpse of it anywhere.</p>

<p>It was disappointing, and troublesome too,
because she had to carry the Bath bun about
with her so long. Not only was it getting hard
and dry, but it was such an awkward thing
for her pocket that she had torn her frock in
the effort to force it in.</p>

<p>"You might a' been carrying brick-bats
about with you, Miss Ruth," said Nurse, "by
the way you've slit your pocket open."</p>

<p>This went on till Ruth began to despair.
"I'll try it one more evening," she said to herself,
"and if it doesn't come then I shall give
it up."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>Once more, therefore, when she was ready to
go downstairs, she took the bun out of the dolls'
house, where she kept it wrapped up in tissue
paper, and squeezed it into her pocket. Rather
hopelessly, but still keeping a careful look-out,
she proceeded slowly on her way, when behold,
just as she reached the top of the last flight,
a little cringing grey figure crossed the hall
below.</p>

<p>"It's come!" she exclaimed in an excited
whisper. "It's come at last!"</p>

<p>But though it had come, it seemed now the
cat's greatest desire to go, for it was hurrying
towards the kitchen stairs.</p>

<p>"Puss! puss!" called out Ruth in an entreating
voice as she hastily ran down. "Stop a
minute! <i>Pretty</i> puss!"</p>

<p>Startled at the noise and the patter of the
quick little feet, the cat paused in its flight
and turned its scared yellow-green eyes upon
Ruth.</p>

<p>She had now reached the bottom step, where
she stood struggling to get the Bath bun out
of her small pocket, her face pink with the
effort and anxiety lest the cat should go before
she succeeded.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>Pretty</i> puss!" she repeated as she tugged at
the parcel. "Don't go away."</p>

<p>One more desperate wrench, which gashed
open the corner of the pocket, and the bun was
out. The cat looked on with one paw raised,
ready to fly at the first sign of danger, as with
trembling fingers Ruth managed to break a
piece off the horny surface. She held it out.
The cat came nearer, sniffed at it suspiciously,
and then to her great joy took the morsel,
crouched down, and munched it up. "How
good it must taste," she thought, "after the
mice and rats."</p>

<p>By degrees it was induced to make further
advances, and before long to come on to the
step where Ruth sat, and make a hearty meal
of the bun which she crumbled up for it.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it's dry," she said; "but I
couldn't bring any milk, you know, and you
must get some water afterwards."</p>

<p>The cat seemed to understand, and replied
by pushing its head against her, and purred
loudly. How thin it was! Ruth wondered as
she looked gravely at it whether it would soon
be fatter if she fed it every day. She became
so interested in talking to it, and watching its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
behaviour, that she nearly forgot she had to
go into the dining-room, and jumped up with
a start.</p>

<p>"Good-night," she said. "If you'll come
again I'll bring you something else another
day." She looked back as she turned the
handle of the heavy door. The cat was sitting
primly upright on the step washing its face
after its meal. "I expect it doesn't feel so
hungry now," thought Ruth as she went into
the room.</p>

<p>The acquaintance thus fairly begun was
soon followed by other meetings, and the cat
was often in the hall when Ruth came downstairs,
though it did not appear every evening.
The uncertainty of this was most exciting,
and "Will it be there to-night?" was her
frequent thought during the day. As time went
on, and they grew to know each other better,
she began to find the kitchen cat a far superior
companion to either her dolls or the man in
the picture. True, it could not answer her any
more than they did&mdash;in words, but it had a
language of its own which she understood
perfectly. She knew when it was pleased, and
when it said "Thank you" for some delicacy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
she brought for it; its yellow eyes beamed
with sympathy and interest when she described
the delights of that beautiful life it would enjoy
in the nursery; and when she pitied it for the
darkness of its present dwelling below, she
knew it understood by the way it rubbed against
her and arched up its back. There were many
more pleasures in each day now that she had
made this acquaintance. Shopping became
interesting, because she could look forward to
the cat's surprise and enjoyment when the
parcel was opened in the evening; everything
that happened was treasured up to tell it when
they met, or, if it was not there, to write to it
on the pink note-paper; the very smartest sash
belonging to her best doll was taken to adorn
the cat's thin neck; and the secrecy which surrounded
all this made it doubly delightful. Ruth
had never been a greedy child, and if Nurse
Smith wondered sometimes that she now spent
all her money on cakes, she concluded that they
must be for a dolls' feast, and troubled herself
no further. Miss Ruth was always so fond of
"making believe". So things went on very
quietly and comfortably, and though Ruth
could not discover that the kitchen cat got any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
fatter, it had certainly improved in some ways
since her attentions. Its face had lost its scared
look, and it no longer crept about as close to
the ground as possible, but walked with an
assured tread and its tail held high. It could
never be a pretty cat to the general eye, but
when it came trotting noiselessly to meet Ruth,
uttering its short mew of welcome, she thought
it beautiful, and would not have changed it for
the sleekest, handsomest cat in the kingdom.</p>

<p>But it was the kitchen cat still. All this did
not bring it one step nearer to the nursery. It
must still live, Ruth often thought with sorrow,
amongst the rats and mice and beetles. Nothing
could ever happen which would induce Nurse
Smith to allow it to come upstairs. And yet
something did happen which brought this very
thing to pass in a strange way which would
never have entered her mind.</p>

<p>The spring came on with a bright sun and cold
sharp winds, and one day Ruth came in from
her walk feeling shivery and tired. She could
not eat her dinner, and her head had a dull
ache in it, and she thought she would like to
go to bed. She did not feel ill, she said, but she
was first very hot and then very cold. Nurse<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Smith sent for the doctor; and he came and
looked kindly at her, and felt her pulse and
said she must stay in bed and he would send
some medicine. And she went to sleep, and
had funny dreams in which she plainly saw
the kitchen cat dressed in Aunt Clarkson's
bonnet and cloak. It stood by her bed and
talked in Aunt Clarkson's voice, and she saw
its grey fur paws under the folds of the cloak.
She wished it would go away, and wondered
how she could have been so fond of it. When
Nurse came to give her something she said
feebly:</p>

<p>"Send the cat away."</p>

<p>"Bless you, my dear, there's no cat here,"
she answered. "There's nobody been here but
me and Mrs. Clarkson."</p>

<p>At last there came a day when she woke up
from a long sleep and found that the pain in
her head was gone, and that the things in the
room which had been taking all manner of
queer shapes looked all right again.</p>

<p>"And how do you feel, Miss Ruth, my dear?"
asked Nurse, who sat sewing by the bedside.</p>

<p>"I'm quite well, thank you," said Ruth.
"Why am I in bed in the middle of the day?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, you haven't been just quite well, you
know," said Nurse.</p>

<p>"Haven't I?" said Ruth. She considered
this for some time, and when Nurse came to
her with some beef-tea in her hand, she asked:</p>

<p>"Have I been in bed more than a day?"</p>

<p>"You've been in bed a week," said Nurse.
"But you'll get along finely now, and be up
and about again in no time."</p>

<p>Ruth drank her beef-tea and thought it over.
Suddenly she dropped her spoon into the cup.
The kitchen cat! How it must have missed
her if she had been in bed a week. Unable
to bear the idea in silence, she sat up in bed
with a flushed face and asked eagerly:</p>

<p>"Have you seen the cat?"</p>

<p>Nurse instantly rose with a concerned expression,
and patted her soothingly on the
shoulder.</p>

<p>"There now, my dear, we won't have any
more fancies about cats and such. You drink
your beef-tea up and I'll tell you something
pretty."</p>

<p>Ruth took up her spoon again. It was of
no use to talk to Nurse about it, but it was
dreadful to think how disappointed the cat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
must have been evening after evening. Meanwhile
Nurse went on in a coaxing tone:</p>

<p>"If so be as you make haste and get well,
you're to go alonger me and stay with your
Aunt Clarkson in the country. There now!"</p>

<p>Ruth received the news calmly. It did not
seem a very pleasant prospect, or even a very
real one to her.</p>

<p>"There'll be little boys and girls to play
with," pursued Nurse, trying to heighten the
picture; "and flowers&mdash;and birds and such&mdash;and
medders, and a garding, and all manner."</p>

<p>But nothing could rouse Ruth to more than
a very languid interest in these delights. Her
thoughts were all with her little friend downstairs;
and she felt certain that it had often
been hungry, and no doubt thought very badly
of her for her neglect. If she could only see
it and explain that it had not been her fault!</p>

<p>The next day Aunt Clarkson herself came.
She always had a great deal on her mind when
she came up to town, and liked to get through
her shopping in time to go back in the afternoon,
so she could never stay long with Ruth.
She came bustling in, looking very strong, and
speaking in a loud cheerful voice, and all the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
while she was there she gave quick glances
round her at everything in the room. Ruth
was well enough to be up, and was sitting in
a big chair by the nursery fire, with picture-books
and toys near; but she was not looking
at them. Her eyes were fixed thoughtfully on
the fire, and her mind was full of the kitchen
cat. She had tried to write to it, but the words
would not come, and her fingers trembled so
much that she could not hold the pencil straight.
The vexation and disappointment of this had
made her head ache, and altogether she presented
rather a mournful little figure.</p>

<p>"Well, Nurse, and how are we going on?"
said Aunt Clarkson, sitting down in the chair
Nurse placed for her. Remembering her dream,
Ruth could not help giving a glance at Aunt
Clarkson's hands. They were fat, round hands,
and she kept them doubled up, so that they
really looked rather like a cat's paws.</p>

<p>"Well, ma'am," replied Nurse, "Miss Ruth's
better; but she's not, so to say, as cheerful as I
could wish. Still a few <i>fancies</i> ma'am," she
added in an undertone, which Ruth heard
perfectly.</p>

<p>"Fancies, eh?" repeated Aunt Clarkson in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
her most cheerful voice. "Oh, we shall get
rid of them at Summerford. You'll have real
things to play with there, Ruth, you know.
Lucy, and Cissie, and Bobbie will be better
than fancies, won't they?"</p>

<p>Ruth gave a faint little nod. She did not
know what her aunt meant by "fancies". The
cat was quite as real as Lucy, or Cissie, or
Bobbie. Should she ask her about it, or did
she hate cats like Nurse Smith? She gazed
wistfully at Mrs. Clarkson's face, who had now
drawn a list from her pocket, and was running
through the details half aloud with an absorbed
frown.</p>

<p>"I shall wait and see the doctor, Nurse,"
she said presently; "and if he comes soon I
shall <i>just</i> get through my business, and catch
the three o'clock express."</p>

<p>No, it would be of no use, Ruth concluded,
as she let her head fall languidly back against
the pillow&mdash;Aunt Clarkson was far too busy to
think about the cat.</p>

<p>Fortunately for her business, the doctor did
not keep her waiting long. Ruth was better,
he said, and all she wanted now was cheering
up a little&mdash;she looked dull and moped. "If<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
she could have a little friend, now, to see her,
or a cheerful companion," glancing at Nurse
Smith, "it would have a good effect."</p>

<p>He withdrew with Mrs. Clarkson to the
door, and they continued the conversation in
low tones, so that only scraps of it reached
Ruth:</p>

<p>"&mdash;excitable&mdash;fanciful&mdash;too much alone&mdash;children
of her own age&mdash;"</p>

<p>Aunt Clarkson's last remark came loud and
clear:</p>

<p>"We shall cure that at Summerford, Dr.
Short. We're not dull people there, and we've
no time for fancies."</p>

<p>She smiled, the doctor smiled, they shook
hands and both soon went away. Ruth leant
her head on her hand. Was there no one who
would understand how much she wanted to
see the kitchen cat? Would they all talk about
fancies? What were Lucy and Cissie and
Bobbie to her?&mdash;strangers, and the cat was a
friend. She would rather stroke its rough
head, and listen to its purring song, than have
them all to play with. It was so sad to think
how it must have missed her, how much she
wanted to see it, and how badly her head<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
ached, that she felt obliged to shed a few tears.
Nurse discovered this with much concern.</p>

<p>"And there was master coming up to see
you to-night and all, Miss Ruth. It'll never do
for him to find you crying, you know. I think
you'd better go to bed."</p>

<p>Ruth looked up with a sudden gleam of hope,
and checked her tears.</p>

<p>"When is he coming?" she asked. "I want
to see him."</p>

<p>"Well, I s'pose directly he comes home&mdash;about
your tea-time. But if I let you sit up
we mustn't have no more tears, you know, else
he'll think you ain't getting well."</p>

<p>Ruth sank quietly back among her shawls in
the big chair. An idea had darted suddenly
into her mind which comforted her very much,
and she was too busy with it to cry any more.
She would ask her father! True, it was hardly
likely that he would have any thoughts to
spare for such a small thing as the kitchen cat;
but still there was just a faint chance that he
would understand better than Nurse and Aunt
Clarkson. So she waited with patience, listening
anxiously for his knock and the slam of the
hall door, and at last, just as Nurse was getting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
the tea ready, it came. Her heart beat fast.
Soon there was a hurried step on the stairs,
and her father entered the room. Ruth studied
his face earnestly. Was he tired? Was he
worried? Would he stay long enough to hear
the important question?</p>

<p>He kissed her and sat down near her.</p>

<p>"How is Miss Ruth to-day?" he said rather
wearily to Nurse.</p>

<p>Standing stiffly erect behind Ruth's chair,
Nurse Smith repeated all that the doctor and
Mrs. Clarkson had said.</p>

<p>"And I think myself, sir," she added, "that
Miss Ruth will be all the better of a cheerful
change. She worrits herself with fancies."</p>

<p>Ruth looked earnestly up at her father's face,
but said nothing.</p>

<p>"Worries herself?" repeated Mr. Lorimer,
with a puzzled frown. "What can she have
to worry about? Is there anything you want,
my dear?" he said, taking hold of Ruth's little
hot hand and bending over her.</p>

<p>The moment had come. Ruth gathered all
her courage, sat upright, and fixing an entreating
gaze upon him said:</p>

<p>"I want to see my best friend."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your best friend, eh?" he answered, smiling
as if it were a very slight affair. "One of your
little cousins, I suppose? Well, you're going to
Summerford, you know, and then you'll see
them all. I forget their names. Tommie, Mary,
Carry, which is it?"</p>

<p>Ruth gave a hopeless little sigh. She was so
tired of these cousins.</p>

<p>"It's none of them," she said shaking her
head. "I don't want any of them."</p>

<p>"Who is it, then?"</p>

<p>"It's the kitchen cat."</p>

<p>Mr. Lorimer started back with surprise at
the unexpected words.</p>

<p>"The kitchen cat!" he repeated, looking distractedly
at Nurse. "Her best friend! What
does the child mean?"</p>

<p>"Miss Ruth has fancies, sir," she began with
a superior smile. But she did not get far, for
at that word Ruth started to her feet in desperation.</p>

<p>"It isn't a fancy!" she cried; "it's a <i>real</i> cat.
I know it very well and it knows me. And I
<i>do</i> want to see it so. <i>Please</i> let it come."</p>

<p>The last words broke off in a sob.</p>

<p>Mr. Lorimer lifted her gently on to his knee.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where is this cat?" he said, turning to
Nurse with such a frown that Ruth thought
he must be angry. "Why hasn't Miss Ruth
had it before if she wanted it?"</p>

<p>"Well, I believe there <i>is</i> a cat somewhere
below, sir," she replied in an injured tone;
"but I'd no idea, I'm sure, that Miss Ruth
was worritting after it. To the best of my
knowledge she's only seen it once. She's so
fond of making believe that it's hard to tell
when she <i>is</i> in earnest. I thought it was a kind
of a fancy she got in her head when she was
ill."</p>

<p>"Fetch it here at once, if you please."</p>

<p>Nurse hesitated.</p>

<p>"It's hardly a fit pet for Miss Ruth, sir."</p>

<p>"At once, if you please," repeated Mr.
Lorimer. And Nurse went.</p>

<p>Ruth listened to this with her breath held,
almost frightened at her own success. Not only
was the kitchen cat to be admitted, but it was
to be brought by the very hands of Nurse herself.
It was wonderful&mdash;almost too wonderful
to be true.</p>

<p>And now it seemed that her father wished
to know how the kitchen cat had become her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
best friend. He was very much interested in it,
and she thought his face looked quite different
while he listened to her to what it looked when
he was reading his papers downstairs. Finding
that he asked sensible questions, and did not
once say anything about "fancies", she was
encouraged to tell him more and more, and at
last leant her head on his shoulder and closed
her eyes. It would be all right now. She had
found someone at last who understood.</p>

<p>The entrance of the kitchen cat shortly afterwards
was neither dignified nor comfortable,
for it appeared dangling at the end of Nurse's
outstretched arm, held by the neck as far as
possible from her own person. When it was
first put down it was terrified at its new surroundings,
and it was a little painful to find
that it wanted to rush downstairs again at once,
in spite of Ruth's fondest caresses. It was
Mr. Lorimer who came to her help, and succeeded
at last in soothing its fears and coaxing
it to drink some milk, after which it settled
down placidly with her in the big chair and
began its usual song of contentment. She examined
it carefully with a grave face, and then
looked apologetically at her father.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>"It doesn't look its <i>best</i>," she said. "Its
paws are white <i>really</i>, but I think it's been in
the coal-hole."</p>

<p>This seemed very likely, for not only its paws
but the smart ribbon Ruth had tied round its
neck was grimy and black.</p>

<p>"It's not <i>exactually</i> pretty," she continued,
"but it's a <i>very</i> nice cat. You can't think how
well it knows me&mdash;generally."</p>

<p>Mr. Lorimer studied the long lean form of
the cat curiously through his eye-glass.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't like a white Persian kitten
better for a pet&mdash;or a nice little dog, now?" he
asked doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>please</i> not," said Ruth with a shocked
expression on her face. "I shouldn't love it
half so well, and I'm sure the kitchen cat
wouldn't like it."</p>

<p>That was a wonderful evening. Everything
seemed as suddenly changed as if a fairy had
touched them with her wand. Not only was
the kitchen cat actually there in the nursery,
drinking milk and eating toast, but there was
a still stranger alteration. This father was quite
different to the one she had known in the dining-room
downstairs, who was always reading and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
had no time to talk. His very face had altered,
for instead of looking grave and far-away it was
full of smiles and interest. And how well he
understood about the kitchen cat! When her
bed-time came he seemed quite sorry to go
away, and his last words were:</p>

<p>"Remember, Nurse, Miss Ruth is to have
the cat here whenever she likes and as long as
she likes."</p>

<p>It was all so strange that Ruth woke up the
next morning with a feeling that she had had
a pleasant dream. The kitchen cat and the new
father would both vanish with daylight; they
were "fancies", as Nurse called them, and not
real things at all. But as the days passed and
she grew strong enough to go downstairs as
usual, it was delightful to find that this was not
the case. The new father was there still. The
cat was allowed to make a third in the party,
and soon learned to take its place with dignity
and composure. But though thus honoured,
it no longer received all Ruth's confidences.
She had found a better friend. Her difficulties,
her questions, her news were all saved up for
the evening to tell her father. It was the best
bit in the whole day.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>On one of these occasions they were all three
sitting happily together, and Ruth had just put
a new brass collar which her father had bought
round the cat's neck.</p>

<p>"I don't want to go to Summerford," she
said suddenly. "I'd much rather stay here
with you."</p>

<p>"And the cat," added Mr. Lorimer as he
kissed her. "Well, you must come back soon
and take care of us both, you know."</p>

<p>"You'll be kind to it when I'm gone, won't
you?" said Ruth. "Because, you know, I don't
think the servants <i>understand</i> cats. They're
rather sharp to it."</p>

<p>"It shall have dinner with me every night,"
said Mr. Lorimer.</p>

<p>In this way the kitchen cat was raised from
a lowly station to great honour, and its life
henceforth was one of peace and freedom. It
went where it would, no one questioned its
right of entrance to the nursery or dared to
slight it in any way. In spite, however, of
choice meals and luxury it never grew fat, and
never, except in Ruth's eyes, became pretty.
It also kept to many of its old habits, preferring
liberty and the chimney-pots at night<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
to the softly-lined basket prepared for its
repose.</p>

<p>But with all its faults Ruth loved it faithfully
as long as it lived, for in her own mind she felt
that she owed it a great deal.</p>

<p>She remembered that evening when, a lonely
little child, she had called it her "best friend".
Perhaps she would not have discovered so soon
that she had a better friend still, without the
kitchen cat.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>
<h2>SARAH'S SUNDAY OUT</h2>

<p>"Who saw Sarah last?"</p>

<p>It was Hester who had seen her last when
she had said good-bye to a friend at the hall
door. That was at eleven o'clock in the morning;
now it was one o'clock in the afternoon, and
there was no Sarah to be found anywhere. Not
in the nursery, not in any of the bedrooms,
not upstairs, not downstairs; every hole and
corner and crevice much too small to hide
Sarah was thoroughly searched. Her name was
called in the fondest tones by every member of
the family from father and mother down to
little Diana, and by all the servants, but there
was no answer. There could be no doubt
about it&mdash;Sarah was lost!</p>

<p>Little Diana was heart-broken. It was
dreadful to think of Sarah out alone in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
noisy London streets, where she knew no one
and no one would know her, where she would
soon get confused and lose her way, and where
all the houses looked so much alike that she
would never, never be able to find her home
again. Perhaps even some wicked person might
steal Sarah, or she might be run over by a
carriage, or bitten by a dog, or&mdash;there were no
end of misfortunes which might happen to her,
for it made it all the more sad to remember that
Sarah could not speak.</p>

<p>Who was Sarah?</p>

<p>Perhaps you may have been thinking that
she was a little girl. Nothing of the kind.
She was the dearest little dog in the world,
with a yellow and white silky coat, and a
very turned-up nose, and goggling, affectionate
dark eyes. She was a gay-tempered little
creature, full of playful coaxing ways, and a
great pet with everyone; but she was fondest
of her mistress, Diana. She went everywhere
with her, knew her step from that of any of the
other children, and would prick up her ears and
listen for it a long way off. Her whole name
was "Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough", and
she was a Blenheim spaniel.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>As befitted her rank, Sarah led a life of
luxury, and had a great many possessions of
her very own. Smart collars and bells, a box
full of different coloured ribbons, a travelling
trunk with her name upon it, a brush and
comb, a warm coat for cold weather, and a
comfortable basket to sleep in. Everything
that heart could desire for comfort or adornment
was hers. She had never been used to
the least roughness or hardship, and certainly
was too delicate to fight her own way in the
world.</p>

<p>And now Sarah was lost! All through that
Sunday everyone was very much disturbed,
and talked of nothing but how they could find
her. If a visitor came in, the conversation was
all about Sarah; but no one seemed to be very
hopeful that she would be brought back. There
were dog-stealers about, they said, and such
a little dog would be easily picked up and
hidden. Poor Diana listened to all this, and got
more and more miserable as the day went on,
for she began to feel quite sure that she should
never see her dear little dog again. She moped
about, got very pale, would not eat her dinner,
and would have been in utter despair if Mother<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
had not given her some comfort. For Mother
was the only person who thought there was
a chance of Sarah's return, and this cheered
Diana, because she had a feeling that Mother
knew everything.</p>

<p>Nevertheless when Monday morning came
and there was no Sarah, Diana went downstairs
in the lowest spirits.</p>

<p>"Immediately after breakfast," said her
mother, "I shall put on my bonnet and go
out to look for Sarah."</p>

<p>"Will you <i>promise</i> to bring her back?" asked
poor little Diana earnestly.</p>

<p>Even Mother could not <i>promise</i>, but she
would do her very best, and when she had
started Diana went up to the nursery somewhat
comforted, to wait as patiently as she
could for her return.</p>

<p>Long, long before that could possibly happen
she stationed herself at the window, and fixed
her eyes on the busy street below. Carts, carriages,
cabs, people, how they all went on and
on without a pause, full of their own business
or pleasure! So many ladies, but not Mother;
so many dogs, small and big, but not one quite
like Sarah. Diana's mouth began to droop more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
and more with disappointment, and she was very
near crying. Even Mother could not bring
Sarah back!</p>

<p>"A watched kettle never boils, Miss Diana,"
said Nurse. "You'd much better come away
from the window and play, and then the time'd
pass quicker."</p>

<p>But Diana would not move. Just as Nurse
spoke she caught sight of a bonnet in the
distance just like Mother's, but she had been
so often deceived that she hardly dared to hope.
It came nearer&mdash;it was opposite the house. Oh,
joy! Mother's face, with an expression of
triumphant satisfaction upon it, looked up to
the nursery window. No wonder it was triumphant,
for under her arm there appeared a
yellow and white head, with silky ears and large
dark eyes. Sarah was found! It seemed almost
too good to be true.</p>

<hr class="min" />

<p>You may imagine how Diana rejoiced over
Sarah and petted her, and how interested she
and everyone else were to hear how the little
dog had been traced to a coachman's house in
a mews close by. Sarah, on her side, seemed
very glad to be with her dear little mistress<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
again, and after returning her caresses curled
herself up and went to sleep on the sofa, no
doubt tired with her adventures. How Diana
wished she could tell her all she had done and
seen on that Sunday when everyone had been
so unhappy about her!</p>

<p>"Where did you go, you darling?" she asked
her over and over again, but Sarah never
answered. She only wagged her fringy tail,
and licked her mistress's hand, and goggled at
her with her full dark eyes. And yet Diana felt
quite sure that she had many strange and interesting
things to tell, if she only could.</p>

<p>One afternoon she was lying on the school-room
sofa with Sarah by her side. It was a very
hot day, the blinds were down and the windows
wide open, so that the distant rumble of the
carts and carriages came up from the street
below. There was an organ playing too, and
as Diana listened dreamily to these noises, and
stroked Sarah's head with one hand, she began
to wonder again about those wonderful adventures.</p>

<p>"Tell me where you went on Sunday," she
whispered once more.</p>

<p>To her great surprise, she plainly heard,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
among all the other noises, the sound of a tiny
voice close to her. She listened eagerly, and
this is what it said:</p>

<p>"You must know, my dear mistress, that I
have long had a great wish to see more of the
world. The park is pleasant enough, but after
all if you are led on a string and not allowed to
speak to other dogs, it soon becomes dull and
tiresome. I wanted to go out alone, into the
busy street, to stay as long as I liked, to take
whatever direction I fancied, and to join in the
amusements of other dogs. In short, I wanted
more freedom; and although I never gave way
to temper or became snappish, I grew more
and more discontented with my safe and pleasant
life. I was so closely watched, however,
that I could never get an opportunity for the
least little stroll alone, and I began to despair,
when, at last, on Sunday, the chance really
came. I was alone in the hall, Hester opened
the door, I slipped out unseen, and there I
was&mdash;free!</p>

<p>"It was delightful to find myself alone on
the door-step, and to hear the door shut behind
me; not that I did not fully intend to go back,
for I love my mistress and am not ungrateful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
for the kindness shown me, but it was so
pleasant to think that for a short time I could
do just as I liked. I soon found, however, that
this was very far from the case.</p>

<p>"At first I trotted along the pavement in the
best spirits, meeting very few dogs, and those
of a very rough kind, so that I did not care to
speak to them. It was, as you remember, a
very hot day. The ground felt quite burning
under my feet, and soon I should have been
thankful to be carried a little while. I got
thirsty too, and I began to look about for a
shady place where I could lie down and rest
out of the sun. Presently I came to a narrow
turning, which looked dark and cool compared
to the bright hot streets. It was quiet too, for
there was only a man in the yard washing a cart,
and a rough-coated grey dog sitting near. I
made up my mind to try this, and trotting up
to the dog made a few remarks about the heat
of the weather. From his replies I soon perceived
that he was quite a common dog, though
very good-natured in manner, and he shortly
told me he belonged to the green-grocer and
that his name was 'Bob'.</p>

<p>"We continued to talk, and before long I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
learnt a good deal about his way of life, which
interested me extremely from its great contrast
to my own. In spite of its hardships there was
something attractive about it too, though quite
out of the question for anyone of delicacy and
refinement. For Bob was a working dog. He
had to be at Covent Garden by daybreak with
his master, to go on all his rounds with him,
and to take care of the vegetables in the cart
while he called at the different houses.</p>

<p>"'And what do you get for all that?' I
asked.</p>

<p>"'I get my food, and a good many kicks
sometimes,' he answered.</p>

<p>"'Poor dog!' I exclaimed, for my heart was
filled with pity for him, and I no longer thought
his an attractive life. 'Why don't you run
away?'</p>

<p>"Bob grinned. 'I'm not so stupid as that,'
he replied. 'Dogs that run away come to bad
ends. Besides, I'm happy enough. I get a
holiday sometimes, and a walk in the park, and
on Sunday I can do what I like.'</p>

<p>"'Dear me!' I exclaimed languidly. 'What
a dreadful life! Now, <i>I</i> have nothing to do but
to please myself every day in the week, and as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
for the park, I go there so often I'm perfectly
sick of it.'</p>

<p>"'Do you get your Sundays out?' asked Bob.</p>

<p>"I hesitated. 'This is really my first
Sunday out,' I replied at length, 'but I intend
in future&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'What's your name?' rudely interrupted
Bob.</p>

<p>"He certainly had no manners at all, but
what could you expect from a dog of low
degree?</p>

<p>"'My name,' I replied, holding up my head
with a slight sniff of disdain, 'is&mdash;Sarah,
Duchess of Marlborough!'</p>

<p>"I had no time to notice the effect of these
words, for they were hardly out of my mouth
when I felt myself seized by a large hand,
lifted into the air, and thrust into someone's
coat pocket. From this humiliating position
I heard the voice of the man washing the cart:</p>

<p>"'That <i>your</i> dorg?' And someone answered,
'It belongs to the lady.'</p>

<p>"You may judge, my dear mistress, how
frightened I felt. Here was a sudden end to
my freedom! Imprisoned in a strange man's
pocket, from which escape was impossible,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
nearly stifled with the smell of tobacco, and
filled with dread as to what would happen next.
I managed to wriggle my head out of the
corner, but saw at once that it would be useless
to think of jumping out, the distance from the
ground being far too great. I remained still
therefore, and as the man walked out of the
yard had a faint hope that he knew where I
lived and was taking me home. Alas! I was
soon disappointed. He turned down a mews,
went into a house I had never seen before, up
some narrow stairs without any carpet, and
entered a room where there sat a large fat man
in his shirt sleeves, smoking and reading a
newspaper. I was placed trembling on the
table by his side, and he took the pipe out of
his mouth and turned his head to look at me.</p>

<p>"'Nice little sort of a fancy dorg,' he said at
last. 'What they call a "Blennum".'</p>

<p>"'Strayed into the yard,' said the man who
had picked me up. 'I'm going to show it to
the missus presently.'</p>

<p>"'Worth a tidy sum,' said the fat man, and
went on smoking.</p>

<p>"Was ever a dog of my rank and position
brought down so low? No one took any more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
notice of me, or seemed to think me of any
importance, and I remained shivering on the
table with large tears rolling down my cheeks.
How I repented my folly! I had wanted to
see the world, and here it was, a miserable
contrast to my happy life at home, where I
was fondled and admired by everyone. Foolish,
foolish little dog that I had been! I began to
think too how my dear little mistress would
miss me, and how they would search everywhere
and call for me in vain, and the more I
thought the more painful it all seemed. A
long and wretched time passed in this way,
during which the fat man, who was a coachman
I afterwards heard, puffed at his pipe
and read his newspaper, sometimes shaking
his head and talking to himself a little. He
hardly seemed to know I was there, and I
believe if the door had been open I could easily
have escaped, for the other man had gone out
of the room. But there was no chance of that;
by and by he came back, took me under his
arm and went out into the street again. Where
was he going, I wondered. He had talked of
the missus, but if the missus was any friend
of his I had no hope that she would prove<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
agreeable. It was a great surprise, therefore,
to find myself a little later in a large house
where there were soft carpets, and pictures,
and flowers, and everything I have been used
to see around me. Not only this, but I was
most warmly received by a lady, who called
me a duck, a darling, a love, and a beauty.
These familiar names, which I had been accustomed
to hear from my birth, made me
feel somewhat at home, and I began to take
comfort. At any rate, I was now with people
who knew how to behave to me, and would
treat me with consideration. I passed the rest
of the day, therefore, in peace, though I still
sighed for my own mistress, and had no appetite
for the new roll and cream offered me.</p>

<p>"All my fears returned, however, for to my
distress I was sent back to sleep at the coachman's
house, where I passed the night full of
anxiety and the most dismal thoughts. How
would all this end? Who can picture my
ecstasy of delight the next morning when I
heard the sound of your mother's voice talking
to the coachman below? I need not tell you
how she had succeeded in tracing me through
the green-grocer, who had seen me picked up in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
the yard, for that you know already. I cannot
help feeling that Bob may have had something
to do with my recovery, for I am sure though
rough in his manners he was a well-meaning
dog. If so, I am grateful to him. To end a
long story, my dear mistress, I must remark
that I have no longer any wish to know more
of the world. It is far too rough and noisy a
place for me, and you need have no fear, therefore,
that I shall try to repeat my experience,
or shall ever forget the lesson taught me by
'my Sunday out'."</p>

<h2>THE TOAD IN THE HOLE</h2>

<p>"When is she coming?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow."</p>

<p>"Are you glad?"</p>

<p>"No. Are you?"</p>

<p>"I don't care. I wonder how long she will
stay. I know Mother said a week, but I dare
say she'll ask her to stay longer as she did last
year."</p>

<p>"Well, I know she'll be tiresome, and I shall
be glad when she goes away."</p>

<p>"I'm going to sleep now."</p>

<p>"Oh, Martha, how soon you always do go to
sleep! I'm not a bit sleepy yet."</p>

<p>A snore from the other little bed soon showed
Betty that further talk was hopeless. She
would have liked to chatter longer, but Martha<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
had a way of falling asleep at the most interesting
points, and Betty knew it would be
useless to try and rouse her now.</p>

<p>So she resigned herself to her own thoughts
with a sigh. Kitty was coming to-morrow!
Coming before Martha and she had had any
enjoyment of their country life together, for
the children had only just left London. Coming
to spoil all their plans and games with her
tiresome ways, just as she had done last year.
Of course she would insist on being first in
everything, on ruling everyone, and would be
as pushing and disagreeable as possible. It
was all very well to say that she was a visitor
and must do as she wished, but that did not
make it any the less provoking.</p>

<p>And then Martha took it all so quietly. It
was almost impossible to rouse her to be angry,
and that was annoying too in its way. "I
suppose," thought Betty, very sleepily now,
"that I ought to try to be patient too, but
sometimes I really <i>can't</i>." She fell asleep
here, and dreamed that Kitty was an immense
"daddy-long-legs" flapping and buzzing about
in her hair.</p>

<p>The next afternoon Kitty arrived, full of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
excitement, and ready to be more than delighted
with everything.</p>

<p>She was eleven years old, just Martha's age,
and Betty was two years younger. Fresh from
her life in London, where there always were
so many lessons to be learned and so little
"fun" of any kind, this beautiful country
home was a sort of paradise to her. To have
no one to scold her, no lessons to learn, no
tiresome straight walks with her governess, and
above all, to have two playfellows always ready
to join in pleasures and games! Kitty was an
only child, and her life was often dull for
want of companionship. Everything went on
very well at first, for there was so much to
do and see that there was no time for disputes.
True, Kitty commanded as much as
ever, and had a way of setting people to rights
which was distinctly trying; but she and Betty
did not come to any open disagreement until
she had been at Holmwood for nearly a week.
Nevertheless there had been many small occasions
on which Betty had felt fretted and
irritated; for Kitty, without the least intending
it, seemed often to choose just the wrong thing
to say and do.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>And then she always wished to do <i>exactly</i>
the same as Martha and herself, and that was
<i>so</i> tiresome.</p>

<p>For instance, all the children were very fond
of dear Miss Grey. But now it was always
Kitty who must sit next to her, Kitty who
rushed to supply her with roses to wear and
strawberries to eat, Kitty who kissed her repeatedly
at the most awkward moments. Martha
and Betty, who naturally felt that Miss Grey
was their <i>own dear</i> Miss Grey, could hardly get
near her at all, and Betty resented this very
much. In fact, she gradually got to dwell so
entirely on these annoyances that she could not
think of Kitty's good qualities at all, and was
quite unable to remember that she was generous
and affectionate, and that her faults, though
tiresome, were partly the result of a longing to
be loved.</p>

<p>At last, the clouds having gathered, the storm
came.</p>

<p>One morning, almost as soon as she got up,
Betty felt that every single thing Kitty did or
said was silly. It did not occur to her that
perhaps she was a little bit cross herself, which
was the real explanation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>After breakfast they all three went down to
the pond, and, dividing the water into shares,
began to fish for frogs and newts.</p>

<p>"In a minute," said Betty to herself as she
watched Kitty, "she'll say Martha and I have
the best places."</p>

<p>It happened just so.</p>

<p>"I say," said Kitty, throwing down her net
and coming close up to Betty, "I've got the
worst place of all, there's nothing to catch in
this part!"</p>

<p>"You haven't tried long enough," said
Martha.</p>

<p>"Let's change," was Kitty's next suggestion
as she stood looking eagerly over Betty's
shoulder.</p>

<p>"All right," said Betty moodily, and she went
round to the part of the pond Kitty had left,
where she almost immediately caught two tadpoles
and a newt.</p>

<p>"Look there!" she cried, holding up her net
triumphantly.</p>

<p>"Oh!" screamed Kitty, "you <i>are</i> lucky. <i>Do</i>
let me try," and she rushed up to Betty's side
and seized hold of the net. But this was too
much. Betty let go of the handle and said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
indignantly, "I shan't fish any more. You're
so unfair; you always are!" And she walked
away in a rage. "Kitty is more tiresome than
ever," she said to herself. "She spoils everything.
I wish she would go away!"</p>

<p>All that day she preserved an attitude of
dignified sulkiness in spite of Kitty's frequent
attempts to make it up. When she came and
threw her arm round her, Betty shook it off
impatiently.</p>

<p>That evening the three little girls were in
the woods with dear Miss Grey and baby Susie,
who was just three years old. Betty was walking
a little behind the others with her eyes fixed
on the ground. It was damp and mossy, and
there was a thick growth of ferns and underwood
at the side of the path. Suddenly she
saw something move quickly through this, and
disappear down a hole. She stopped and
moved aside the ferns and moss. What do
you think she saw sitting comfortably in the
hole and staring at her with its moist bright
eyes?</p>

<p>A large speckled toad!</p>

<p>"Look, look, Miss Grey!" she cried, and
everyone gathered round to see what she had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
found. Even Susie peered into the hole, and
poked a bit of fern gently at the toad, which
sat there gazing quietly at them.</p>

<p>"What a jolly little home he's made for himself!"
said Martha. "All soft and moist, and
just exactly to fit him."</p>

<p>"He can't see out much," said Betty as she
put back the moss gently over the top.</p>

<p>"I don't think he wants to," said Miss Grey.
"He is quite satisfied, like many other people
who live in holes."</p>

<p>The children ran on through the wood,
except Betty, who kept back and took hold of
Miss Grey's hand.</p>

<p>"What do you mean about living in holes?"
she asked presently.</p>

<p>"Well, you know, we all live in holes of one
kind or another. Some are rough and some
smooth, some fit us exactly, and some don't fit
us at all. Some are softly lined with all sorts
of comforts, and some are full of pricks and
troubles. And it is always very difficult to see
out of them."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Betty.</p>

<p>"Because, like the toad's hole we saw just
now, our own lives are so near us and surround<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
us so closely, that it is only by making an
effort that we can get out of them and understand
other people's lives at all. The only
thing that can really make us do that is sympathy."</p>

<p>"What does that mean?"</p>

<p>"It is that which makes us able to put ourselves
in thought into other people's holes, and
feel what it is like to live there. When we do
that it makes us remember to be patient and
gentle with our friends and companions, for if
they live in uncomfortable holes it must be
difficult for them to be unselfish and amiable.
If we had their troubles and vexations we might
not be half so pleasant as they are."</p>

<p>Betty was silent.</p>

<p>"Do you think Martha's hole and mine is
nicer than Kitty's?" she said at last.</p>

<p>"Well, I think in some ways it may be. At
any rate you know Kitty has no sisters to play
with, and very little of this country life you
all enjoy so much. While her holiday lasts I
should try to make it as pleasant as possible
for her, if I were you."</p>

<p>"I do," said Betty, "generally. Only sometimes
she makes me feel so cross."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>At this moment up rushed Kitty, and elbowed
Betty away from Miss Grey's side.</p>

<p>"You've had her long enough!" she shouted.
"It's my turn now!"</p>

<p>And Betty was thinking so much about the
toad in the hole, that she did not even frown.</p>
